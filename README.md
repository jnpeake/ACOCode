# ACOCode

Public repository of the Ant Colony Optimisation code used during my PhD. This code contributed to the papers:

[Vectorized Candidate Set Selection for Parallel Ant Colony Optimization](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3205651.3208274)

[Scaling Techniques for Parallel Ant Colony Optimization on Large Problem Instances](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3321707.3321832)

and my PhD thesis:

[Parallelised and Vectorised Ant Colony Optimisation](https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/628905/1/main.pdf)

The code was never supposed to see the light of day so it may be a bit messy. The CodeClean branch should contain the most up to date code.

The NovelACO branch is in active use for testing a new hybrid ACO-Novelty Search algorithm.
